# React Foor order App

<sub>Disclaimer: This project was built for educational purposes as a part of the "React-The Complete Guide" course on Udemy, taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller</sub>

## Overview:

This is a simple food ordering app where users can choose from a preset list of meals, add them to cart and place an order.

## Tech used and learnings:

1. **ReactJs:**

- Used create-react-app to set up the project and dev enviroment.
- Used reactjs to create re-usable functional components.
- Used CSS modules for styling components without polluting the global CSS namespace.
- Used the `useState` and `useReducer` hooks to manage local state of components.
- Used the `Context API` and `useContext` hook to manage app wide state (cart).
- Created a custom `use-AJAX` hook to make api calls to fetch the meal list from and store the orders to a database.
- Implemented slightly complex form validation login on the front-end.

2. **React-Transition-Group:**

- used the `react-transition-group` library to add subtle animation to the react app.

3. **FireBase:**

- Used real-time database service offered by Google Firebase;

//react, react-transition-group, firebase.
